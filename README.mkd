< Remosi> I figure you should write a C daemon that takes  (v4) prefix and a
command to run. It runs the command every 30s, if the command returns exit
level 0 3 times in a row, then it starts sending ripv2 packets with the prefix,
if it returns non zero 3 times in a row, it sends ripv2 packets with the
distance set to infinity.
< Remosi> should be a simple C program
